                            <p>This sweepstakes (“Sweepstakes”) is sponsored by Half Baked Harvest, LLC (“Sponsor”) and is open only to legal residents of the United States including the District of Columbia (but excluding Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and all other U.S. territories and possessions) (“Eligibility Area”) and shall be construed according to, and governed exclusively by, U.S. law.

                            <p>SWEEPSTAKES DESCRIPTION</p>
                            <p>The Sweepstakes begins on or about 12:01 AM ET on December 6, 2024 and ends at 12:01 AM ET on December 13, 2024 (the “Sweepstakes Period”).

Multiple entries from the same email address will be automatically disqualified. In case of dispute, an entry will be declared made by the authorized account holder of the e-mail address submitted at the time of entry. “Authorized account holder” is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet Access Provider, on-line service provider, or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.

Automated entries are prohibited, and any use of such automated devices will cause disqualification.</p>
                            <p>HOW TO ENTER/ENTRIES</p>

                            <p>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION</p>
                            <p>At the end of the Sweepstakes Period, the Winners from all eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Period will be notified.

If, despite reasonable efforts, a potential Winner does not respond within twelve (12) hours of the first notification attempt, or if the Prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to such potential Winner, such potential Winner will forfeit his or her Prize and an alternate Winner may be selected. If any potential Winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Sweepstakes Rules, or declines the Prize for any reason prior to award, such potential Winner will be disqualified and an alternate Winner may be selected. </p>

EACH WINNER SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE  FOR ALL FEDERAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL TAXES, AND THE REPORTING CONSEQUENCES THEREOF, AND FOR ANY OTHER FEES OR COSTS (INCLUDING MEALS AND INSURANCE) ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICABLE PRIZE. Potential Winners will be required to execute an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Release, and (where legal) a Publicity Release (collectively, “Prize Claim Documents”). WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, PRIZES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND SPONSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT</span>.</p>
                            <p>GENERAL LIABILITY RELEASE/FORCE MAJEURE</p>
                            <p>By participating or accepting the Prize, Winner hereby releases, discharges and covenants not to sue Sponsor, and any of their affiliates, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors in interest, assigns, officers, directors, shareholders, employees and agents, past and present, in any and all capacities (collectively, “Released Parties”), in respect of any and all claims, damages, charges, injuries, losses, proceedings, suits, actions (including, but not limited to, tort actions, product liability actions, wrongful death actions, warranty actions, breach of contract actions, privacy and defamation actions, misappropriation of likeness actions, loss of consortium claims, etc.), expenses and attorney fees (“Claims”) that Winner or anyone on Winner’s behalf (including, but not limited to, Winner’s  heirs, representatives or next of kin) have or might have for any death, injury, damage or claimed injury or damage, arising out of, involving or relating to Winner’s  participation in the Sweepstakes, including, but not limited to, any claim that the act or omission complained of was caused in whole or in part by the strict liability or negligence in any form of the Released Parties (including use of the Prize). Winner further agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Released Parties in any action or proceeding from and against all Claims, expenses and attorney fees, that Winner or anyone on Winner’s  behalf (including, but not limited to, Winner’s  heirs, representatives or next of kin) have or might have for any death, injury, damage or claimed injury or damage, arising out of, involving or relating to Winner’s  participation in the Sweepstakes, use of the Prizes, or for Winner’s  failure to comply with the terms hereof. This agreement to indemnify, hold harmless and defend applies even if the act or omission complained of was allegedly caused in whole or in part by the strict liability or negligence in any form of the Released Parties. Released Parties assume no responsibility for any damage to a Winner’s or any other person’s computer system or wireless phone which is occasioned by participating in the Sweepstakes, or for any computer system, phone line, hardware, software or program malfunctions, or other errors, failures, delayed computer transmissions or network connections that are human or technical in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Released Parties are not responsible for incomplete, illegible, misdirected, misprinted, late, lost, damaged, stolen, or postage-due submissions or prize notifications; or for lost, interrupted, inaccessible or unavailable networks, servers, satellites, Internet service providers, websites, or other connections; or for miscommunications, failed, jumbled, scrambled, delayed, or misdirected computer, telephone or cable transmissions; or for any technical malfunctions, failures, difficulties or other errors of any kind or nature; or for the incorrect or inaccurate capture of information, or the failure to capture any information. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual who is found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes, to be acting in violation of these Official Sweepstake Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes, or to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, and Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. No mechanically reproduced, illegible, incomplete, forged, software-generated or other automated multiple entries will be accepted. Sponsor reserves the right to modify, extend, suspend or terminate the Sweepstakes if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Sweepstakes is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical problems, failures or malfunctions or other causes beyond Sponsor’s control have destroyed or severely undermined or to any degree impaired the integrity, administration, security, proper play and/or feasibility of the Sweepstakes as contemplated herein. In the event Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with the Sweepstakes as contemplated herein by any event beyond its control, including but not limited to fire, flood, natural or man-made epidemic of health of other means, earthquake, explosion, labor dispute or strike, act of God or public enemy, satellite or equipment failure, riot or civil disturbance, terrorist threat or activity, war (declared or undeclared) or any federal state or local government law, order, or regulation, public health crisis (e.g., COVID), order of any court or jurisdiction, or other cause not reasonably within Sponsor’s control (each a “Force Majeure” event or occurrence), then Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Sweepstakes. If the Sweepstakes is terminated before its designated end date, Sponsor will (if possible) select winners in a random drawing from all eligible, non-suspect entries received as of the date of the event giving rise to the termination. Inclusion in such drawing shall be each entrant’s sole and exclusive remedy under such circumstances. Only the type of prizes described in these Official Rules will be awarded. If, for any reason, more bona fide winners come forward seeking to claim prizes in excess of the number of each type of prize set forth in these Official Rules, the winners, or remaining winners, as the case may be, of the advertised number of prizes available in the prize category in question may be selected in a random drawing from among all persons making purportedly valid claims for such prize(s). Inclusion in such drawing shall be each entrant’s sole and exclusive remedy under such circumstances. These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a written document issued in accordance with law by a duly authorized representative of Sponsor. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.</p>
                            <p>GOVERNING LAW/JURISDICTION</p>
                            <p>ALL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES OR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ENTRANTS OR SPONSOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SWEEPSTAKES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OF CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY. </p>
                            <p>ARBITRATION PROVISION</p>
                            <p>By participating in this Sweepstakes, each entrant agrees that any and all disputes the entrant may have with, or claims entrant may have against, the Sponsor relating to, arising out of or connected in any way with (i) the Sweepstakes, (ii) the awarding or redemption of the Prize, and/or (iii) the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved individually and exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS (the “Forum”) and conducted before a sole arbitrator pursuant to JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles County, California. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Official Rules and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable participant may have entered into in connection with the Sweepstakes. There shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only the participant’s and/or Sponsor’s individual claims and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
